# Hangman

## Project description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. 
This is an implementation of the hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.
Currently the user is asked to input a letter, this letter is checked to be alphabetical and length 1, and then it is compared to a random word to see if the letter is within this. 

## Installation and usage
All files are currently Python files and so can simply be downloaded to run. All module used are from those pre-installed within Python.

## File structure
All Python files are found within the folder "hangman".
milestone_2.py asks a user to input a single letter and this is checked to be length one and alphabetical.
milestone_3.py expands upon this, and takes this checked letter (once chnaged to lowercase) and compares it to a randomly generated word to see if the letter is in it, telling the user the outcome.
